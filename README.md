Sampling an analog signal is a crucial step for any digital signal processing system. The Nyquistâ€“Shannon  sampling theorem guarantees a full recovery of the signal when sampling with a frequency larger than or equal to the  bandwidth of the signal (or double the maximum frequency in case of real signals).
